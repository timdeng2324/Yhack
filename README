First, go to Facebook settings, and click the link at the bottom that says "Download a copy" of your Facebook data.
Follow the instructions (this might take some time, since it has to process).
Once you've downloaded all the data, find messages.htm and put it in the same folder as the source code.
Run rm.pl and redirect output to a file called out.txt (perl rm.pl > out.txt).
Compile Convo.java (javac Convo.java).

Run Convo.java to talk to the computer (java Convo).
When it prompts you with "Hey! Who are you talking to?", you can give the program a name.
Proceed to talk to it. You can say "bye" to quit.
